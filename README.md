Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
======================================

You can find a several scripts about assignment the Getting and Cleaning Data course

i. In the script called run_analysis.R, you can find the code that you can use to resolve this assignment

ii. In CodeBook.md you can find variables description. It's useful for you can understand the assignment

iii. The raw data for the project you can download for the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

iv. A full description is available at the site where the data raw was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


Steps to resolve assignment 2 Getting and Cleaning Data
=======================================================

I describe briefly the steps to resolve the project

i. Install and load packages data.table and reshape2

ii. Checking for and creating directory

iii. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

iv. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

v. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

vi. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

vii. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

How to run the code?
=================

You can run th code with the command Rscript run_analysis.R
